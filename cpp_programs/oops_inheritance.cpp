/**********************************************************
* Properties of an existing class can be reused by a new  *
* class through inheritance.  Existing class is termed b- *
* ase class whereas the class that inherits properties f- *
* from a base class is termed derived class.  For e.g.,   *
* we made a class employee, and we are told that we need  *
* to also input data for a programmer, manager, etc.  Th- *
* en programmer etc will inherit properties of employee   *
* class, and this will save a lot of time and effort, as  *
* we do not have to write separately for all other relat- *
* ed classes.  There are different types of inheritance.  *
* We can add properties to derived classes based on req.  *
* Few types of inheritance are:                           *
*   single, multiple, heirarchical, multilevel, hybrid.   *
*                                                         *
* -> Single: one derived class from only one base class.  *
* -> Mulitple: one derived class from multiple base class *
*              such as: programmer from employee and ass- *
*              istant.
* -> Heirarchical: multiple derived from one base, such   *
*                  as: programmer and manager from emplo- *
*                  yee alone.                             *
* -> Multilevel: derived from a derived class, such as:   *
*                animal->mammal->cow.  Cow is derived fr- *
*                om mammal, and mammal is derived from a- *
*                nimals.                                  *
* -> Hybrid: combination of multiple and multilevel inhe- *
*            ritance. Animal->(mammal, bird)->bat         *
